| **4.1 Concepts of Privacy and Security** | Protect sensitive **data** through **design and advanced techniques**.                 | **Privacy by Design**. Techniques: **PETs** (Privacy-Enhancing Technologies) such as **Differential Privacy**, **Federated Learning**, **Homomorphic Encryption**. Link to **SDG 16** (security, justice).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **4.2 Theory of Robustness and Safety**  | Identify and mitigate threats to the **integrity and stability** of AI models.         | **Adversarial Attacks**, **Data Poisoning**, **Model Inversion**. Strategies: **Red Teaming**, **Safety Case** development, Out-of-Distribution detection, and calibration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **4.3 Conceptual Model Management**      | Implement **operational processes** to ensure the responsible lifecycle of AI systems. | **MLOps** with ethical checks, **Drift Monitoring**, **Fairness Dashboards**, **Model Risk Management (MRM)**, **Synthetic Data (GANs)**, **Decommissioning**, **Incident Response Plan**. **BUC Model integration:** Serves as the source of truth for scope, functional requirements, and operational thresholds; guides intervention if drift, fairness, or risk metrics violate original business objectives. Link to **TRL** and strategic risk analysis. |
Module 4 focuses on the **operational and technical defense** of Responsible AI. It ensures that AI systems are not only ethically designed (Modules 1–3) but also **safe, private, and reliable** under various conditions. It introduces the critical processes (**MLOps, MRM**) necessary to maintain accountability **throughout the entire lifecycle**.
