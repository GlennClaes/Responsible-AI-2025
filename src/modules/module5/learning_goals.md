## **Module 5: Auditing, Sustainability, and Societal Impact**

**Goal:** Understand theoretical approaches to **auditing**, **sustainability**, and **systemic effects** to ensure broad societal accountability.

| **Submodule**                                  | **Focus & Learning Objective**                                                                 | **Key Concepts**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **5.1 Theory of Auditing and Validation**      | Master the methods for **monitoring** and **validating** AI systems for compliance and ethics. | Distinction between **Compliance Audit** and **Ethical Audit**. Importance of **Provenance**, version control, and immutable **Audit Trails**. Validation of accuracy, robustness, and explainability. Link to **Governance** and **SDG 16**. |
| **5.2 Socioeconomic and Environmental Impact** | Evaluate the **broader impact** of AI on society and the environment.                          | **Socioeconomic impact** (employment, inequality, democracy). **Environmental impact** (energy use, **Carbon Footprint**). Link to **SDGs** (8, 10, 13) and theoretical sustainability models.                                                |
| **5.3 AI at a Systemic Level**                 | Reflect on AI as a **societal system** and prepare for inevitable failures.                    | **Collective/Systemic Bias**. The vision of **AI as a public good**. Theoretical models for **Exit Strategy** and responsible **Decommissioning** in case of ethical or safety risks. Reflection on **TRL progression**.                      |

Module 5 is the **concluding and reflective module**. It focuses on **external accountability** through rigorous **auditing** and **validation**. It compels learners to shift focus from the individual AI system to its **collective and systemic impact** (social, environmental) and emphasizes the importance of a responsible exit strategy.
