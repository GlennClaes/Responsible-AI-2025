## **Module 1: Foundations and Strategic Framework**

Module 1 lays the groundwork for understanding **Responsible AI** by defining the _what_ and _why_ of ethical and strategic AI implementation. It provides the conceptual, ethical, and legal basis for developing and deploying AI systems in a way that aligns with both organizational goals and societal expectations.

The module consists of three key submodules:

1. **Principles of Responsible AI (1.1)**  
    This submodule focuses on understanding the **core values** that should guide AI development and deployment. It explores the fundamental principles of **Fairness**, **Transparency**, **Reliability**, **Privacy**, **Accountability**, and **Inclusiveness** across the entire AI lifecycle. Participants learn how to identify and analyze potential risks in AI systems through theoretical risk frameworks and ethical evaluations.
    
2. **Normative and Regulatory Frameworks (1.2)**  
    This section provides insight into the **mandatory and guiding frameworks** that shape legal compliance for AI in Europe and globally. It covers the **GDPR** and the **EU AI Act**, including the **Four-Layer Risk Model**, and introduces the **OECD AI Principles** as international benchmarks. The submodule explains the hierarchy from **principles → guidelines → processes → conformity**, emphasizing the importance of **Conformity Assessment** and **Quality Management Systems** in ensuring responsible and lawful AI deployment.
    
3. **Strategic Context and Societal Value (1.3)**  
    The final submodule connects AI initiatives to the broader **corporate strategy** and **societal impact**. It highlights the importance of aligning AI projects with the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** to create societal value. Participants learn how to use **Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)** to evaluate AI maturity and apply the **Gartner Hype Cycle** to manage expectations and assess the technological and academic positioning of AI innovations.
    

In essence, **Module 1** defines the ethical foundations, legal boundaries, and strategic relevance of Responsible AI. It ensures that learners understand not only _what_ responsible AI is and _why_ it matters, but also how it integrates into organizational strategy and societal progress.
