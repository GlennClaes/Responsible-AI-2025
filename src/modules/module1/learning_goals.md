| **1.3 Strategic Context and Societal Value** | Positioning AI projects within **corporate strategy** and **societal expectations**.             | Linking AI to **SDGs** (societal value). Using **TRLs** (Technology Readiness Levels) to assess AI maturity and applying the **Gartner Hype Cycle** for expectation management and academic positioning of technology.                                                                      |

Module 1 defines the **“What and Why”** of Responsible AI: it establishes which ethical principles should be followed (1.1), which laws and regulations must be complied with (1.2), and how the AI project fits within the broader strategic context and technological maturity of the organization and society (1.3).
