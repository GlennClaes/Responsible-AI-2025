## **Module 2: Fairness, Bias, and Explainability (Ethical Core)**

Module 2 forms the **ethical core** of Responsible AI. Building on the foundational principles from Module 1, it focuses on the **practical and theoretical mechanisms** needed to identify and correct bias, ensure transparency in AI models, and embed ethical reasoning throughout the AI lifecycle. The module emphasizes not only how to make AI systems fair and explainable, but also how to navigate the complex **ethical trade-offs** that accompany real-world AI applications.

The module consists of three submodules:

1. **Theory of Bias and Fairness (2.1)**  
    This submodule explores the **nature, sources, and types of bias** in AI systems, helping participants recognize how biases can arise and propagate through data and algorithms. It distinguishes between **Data Bias**, **Algorithmic Bias**, and **Use Bias**, and introduces the **four stages of bias analysis** for systematic evaluation. Learners examine **bias mitigation strategies** at different stages of the AI pipeline—**pre-processing**, **in-processing**, and **post-processing**—and understand how these approaches contribute to **restoring fairness**. The submodule links directly to **SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)**, reinforcing the societal dimension of fairness in AI.
    
2. **Explainability and XAI (2.2)**  
    This submodule addresses the importance of **transparency** in AI decision-making. Participants learn to differentiate between **Interpretability** (understanding model behavior) and **Explainability (XAI)** (communicating decisions effectively). It introduces key XAI techniques such as **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** and **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**, providing both theoretical grounding and practical understanding. Learners also become familiar with documentation standards like **Model Cards** and **Data Sheets**, which support traceability and accountability. The submodule emphasizes **risk-based explanation levels**, ensuring that explanations are appropriate to the AI system’s impact and use case.
    
3. **Ethical Theory and the Human Factor (2.3)**  
    The final submodule connects ethical reasoning directly to AI practice. It introduces classical **ethical frameworks**—**Utilitarianism** (outcome-based ethics) and **Deontology** (duty-based ethics)—and applies them to AI decision-making contexts. Participants explore the critical role of human oversight through **Human-in-the-Loop** and **Human-over-the-Loop** models, addressing challenges such as the **“Gap Problem”** and phenomena like **moral dumbfounding**. The submodule concludes with discussions on balancing **Performance**, **Fairness**, and **Societal Impact**, highlighting that ethical AI often involves managing tensions between competing values.
    

In summary, **Module 2** equips learners with the knowledge and tools to **recognize, measure, mitigate, and explain bias** in AI systems, while grounding these practices in robust ethical theory and human-centered oversight. It transforms abstract principles into actionable skills that ensure AI systems are not only effective but also just, transparent, and aligned with human values.
