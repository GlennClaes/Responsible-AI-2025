The Hamburg Declaration is a global commitment endorsed by governments, international organizations, civil society, academia, and the private sector to promote the responsible, inclusive, and sustainable use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Adopted during the Hamburg Sustainability Conference in June 2025, the declaration outlines a human-centered, human-rights-based approach to AI development and governance.

## Key Points

- **Prosperity:** Foster inclusive economic growth by supporting local innovation, skills development, and equitable access to AI infrastructure.
    
- **Peace:** Safeguard information integrity and prevent the misuse of AI for disinformation, social division, or online harm.
    
- **Partnerships:** Encourage multistakeholder collaboration, open data, and AI as a global public good to address shared challenges.
    

The declaration calls for collective action, transparency, accountability, and inclusive partnerships to ensure that AI benefits all people and the planet, leaving no one behind.
