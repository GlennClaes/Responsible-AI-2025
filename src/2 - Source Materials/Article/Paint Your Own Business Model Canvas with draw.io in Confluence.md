## Summary

This article provides an overview of the Business Model Canvas (BMC) framework, illustrating its nine key components: Key Partnerships, Key Activities, Key Resources, Value Propositions, Customer Relationships, Channels, Customer Segments, Revenue Streams, and Cost Structure. While the article demonstrates how to create a BMC using draw.io in Confluence, its main value for this work was as a reference for understanding the structure, terminology, and visual layout of a Business Model Canvas. The template served as inspiration for designing a custom BMC for ethical AI solutions.

## Key Points

- **BMC Structure:** The nine building blocks of the Business Model Canvas provide a clear framework for describing and analyzing a business model.
    
- **Visualization:** The article emphasizes the benefits of visually representing business models to improve clarity and comprehension.
    
- **Practical Template:** While focused on draw.io, the template helps users conceptualize how components of a business model relate to each other.
    
- **Inspiration:** The layout and examples in the article inspired the creation of a custom BMC for ethical AI solutions, rather than serving as a step-by-step guide.
